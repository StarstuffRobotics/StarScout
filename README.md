## Plans for the future
Currently the StarScout app is for FRC #9403 use only. However, Starstuff's Scouting Lead would like to publish the app in future seasons and make it fully open-source to benefit the wider FRC community and empower teams across the globe to enhance their scouting and strategic planning capabilities.
